# oeo-viewer

1- To build and create the minimized version, run:
`npm run build`

This will generate a series of files inside the `dist` folder. 

2- To update the OpenEnergy platform, copy all generated files inside the `dist` folder and copy them over into the `oeo-viewer/static` directory in the OpenEnergy platform.

Done!
